this one is the first code to understand the deep neural network
I have started 100 days challange on spatial analysis using deep learning
1. Day1- I have installed miniconda3 and purchase a book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition" and starts to learn from chapter 10 
   I installed scikit-learn, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, pandas and other supported libraries
   I try to understand how the perceptron actually works so that I load iris datasets play with them
   created percepreon module, train it and make prediction

   
2. Day2- One complete classification project using secqential model (Model creation, optimization, training, evaluation, and making prediction)
  Familier with input layer, Flatten, dense layer, pandas dataframe, sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function, stochastic gradient descent and adam optimizer, pyplot library

3. Day3- Prepare, train and evaluate Multi layer perceptron . It is alomost same as classification except loss function is mean squared error, output is only one neuron and there is no any activation function in output layer
4. Day4- Today i learn how to create flowchart using python and by applying this concept i try to understand how complex multi layer perceptron works
